          <span i18n
            >From 2021 to 2024, I led the charge on 2 amazing projects for Stellantis' customers: an AI-driven vehicle
            Search Engine and an Order Tracking module connected with the supply chain management system. I worked with

            In 2015, I joined Groupe PSA‚Äôs Digital Factory and became a key player in facilitating Innovation committees
            and developing proof of concepts on the latest trends: Internet-Of-Things, Real-time 3D, Progressive Web
            Apps, Chatbots & Vocal Assistants.

          <span i18n
            >In 2006, I worked in an advertising agency that quickly became a powerhouse, thanks to a great creative
            director and some self-taught skills in producing media.</span

        <h4>Special thanks</h4>
        <p>
          The leadership I encountered in a variety of experiences pushed me to grow and develop in ways I never thought
          possible.
