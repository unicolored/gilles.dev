          Throughout my career, I've tackled every stage of web development and deployment, from brewing the coffee ☕️
          to scaling cloud infrastructure, writing tons of code, testing it thoroughly, building containers in CI/CD
          pipelines, and celebrating successful launches.

          My creative journey began with traditional drawing and sketching. Soon, I was exploring the world of computer
          graphics, playing with photo editing and 3D modeling. Later, I honed my skills in print design and branding
          before diving headfirst into web design. Back then, smartphones hadn't even conquered the world yet.
