          <b>From 2021 to 2024</b>, I led the charge on 2 amazing projects for Stellantis' customers: an AI-driven
          vehicle Search Engine and an Order Tracking module for e-commerce platforms. I worked with teams from around
          the globe, connecting me with diverse cultures and perspectives.
        </p>
        <p i18n>
          <b>In 2015</b>, I joined Groupe PSA‚Äôs Digital Factory and became a key player in facilitating Innovation
          committees and developing proof of concepts on the latest trends: Internet-Of-Things, Real-time 3D,
          Progressive Web Apps, Chatbots & Vocal Assistants.
        </p>
        <h3>The beginning</h3>
        <p i18n>
          <b>In 2006</b>, I worked in an advertising agency that quickly became a powerhouse, thanks to a great creative
          director and self-taught skills in producing media.
        </p>
        <p i18n>
          <b>My first big win?</b> Writing <u>Scan & Retouche d'Images</u>, a book on photo manipulation for
          MicroApplication that sold ~20,000 copies.
        </p>
        <p i18n>
          <b>Before that</b>, I studied academic drawings, video montage and art history (but that's old news now).
        </p>
        <h3>Thank you!</h3>
        <p>
          The leadership I encountered in the variety of experiences pushed me to grow and develop in ways I never
          thought possible. Thank you everyone!
        </p>
        <p i18n>Special thanks to God without who nothing's possible!</p>
